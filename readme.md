## About the Project  

This project is an **end-to-end encrypted messaging and knowledge-sharing web application** designed to support:  
- **Real-time messaging**  
- **User roles and permissions**  
- **A collaborative knowledge repository**  

By applying **user-centered design methodologies**, the application ensures intuitive navigation and accessibility. The development focused on **security, scalability, and user experience**, making it a robust solution for private and secure communication.  

### Project Background  

This project was developed as part of a **university coursework**, requiring a balance between **usability and security**. Security was a top priority, leading to the implementation of multiple protective measures.  

### Security Features  

To ensure secure communication, the following security mechanisms were implemented:  

- **Hashed and Salted Passwords**  
  - User passwords are securely stored using industry-standard hashing and salting techniques.  

- **End-to-End Encryption with Public Key Cryptography**  
  - Messages between users are encrypted using a **Diffie-Hellman key exchange** to establish a shared secret key.  
  - The frontend generates a public-private key pair, ensuring that only the intended recipients can decrypt messages.  
  - The server **only stores encrypted messages**, preventing unauthorized access.  

- **HTTPS Implementation**  
  - All communications are secured using **HTTPS** to prevent interception and man-in-the-middle attacks.  

This project demonstrates a **strong emphasis on both usability and security**, ensuring a seamless yet protected user experience.
